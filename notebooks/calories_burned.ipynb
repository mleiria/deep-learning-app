    "Package com.samsung.shealth.calories_burned.details\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very interesting and data-rich JSON object from Samsung Health. The package `com.samsung.shealth.calories_burned.details` appears to be a summary of a day's or a specific period's caloric burn, combining user profile information with activity-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each part of the JSON structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-Level Fields: User Profile and Daily Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "These fields provide the context for the calorie calculation, including the user's physical metrics and a total summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `\"age\": 52`: The user's age is 52.\n",
    "*   `\"gender\": \"M\"`: The user's gender is Male.\n",
    "*   `\"height\": 178.0`: The user's height is 178.0 cm.\n",
    "*   `\"weight\": 78.0`: The user's weight is 78.0 kg.\n",
    "*   `\"stepCount\": 9518`: The total number of steps recorded for the period is 9,518.\n",
    "*   `\"activityLevel\": 180005`: This is likely a proprietary score from Samsung representing the overall activity level for the day. It's a raw or aggregated value, possibly derived from accelerometer data (similar to `com.samsung.health.movement`), that quantifies total physical movement. A higher number indicates a more active day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `\"activityList\"` Array\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most detailed part of the JSON. It's an array that breaks down the calories burned and other metrics by the type of activity performed. It appears to separate specific, logged exercises from general, all-day activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the two objects inside the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Object in `activityList`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"activeTime\": 3560704,\n",
    "  \"calorie\": 631.816,\n",
    "  \"distance\": 18926.936,\n",
    "  \"type\": 11007\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `\"activeTime\": 3560704`: This is the duration of the activity in **milliseconds**. `3,560,704` ms is equal to approximately **59.3 minutes**.\n",
    "*   `\"calorie\": 631.816`: The total number of calories burned during this specific activity, which is 631.8 kcal.\n",
    "*   `\"distance\": 18926.936`: The distance covered during the activity, likely in **meters**. `18,926.9` meters is **18.93 km**.\n",
    "*   `\"type\": 11007`: This is an activity type code. Based on common Samsung Health SDK enumerations, `11007` corresponds to **Cycling** or **Biking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for this object:** This represents a logged cycling workout that lasted about 59 minutes, covered 18.9 km, and burned approximately 632 calories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Object in `activityList`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"activeTime\": 5446055,\n",
    "  \"calorie\": 318.80756,\n",
    "  \"distance\": 6632.5,\n",
    "  \"type\": -1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `\"activeTime\": 5446055`: The active time in milliseconds. `5,446,055` ms is equal to approximately **90.8 minutes** or **1.5 hours**.\n",
    "*   `\"calorie\": 318.80756`: The number of calories burned is about 319 kcal.\n",
    "*   `\"distance\": 6632.5`: The distance covered is `6,632.5` meters or **6.63 km**.\n",
    "*   `\"type\": -1`: This is a special activity code. In many systems, `-1` or `0` is used as a catch-all or default category. In this context, it most likely represents **general, non-exercise activity**. This includes calories burned from walking, daily chores, and other movements that aren't part of a specific, logged workout. The `stepCount` of 9,518 is likely associated with the metrics in this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for this object:** This represents the user's general daily activity (excluding the bike ride), which amounted to about 1.5 hours of active time, covered 6.6 km, and burned approximately 319 calories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `com.samsung.shealth.calories_burned.details` data package provides a comprehensive daily summary. For this user—a 52-year-old male, 178 cm tall, and weighing 78 kg—the data shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A specific **cycling workout** of about an hour that burned **632 calories**.\n",
    "2.  General daily activity that burned an additional **319 calories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure is powerful because it allows the Samsung Health app to distinguish between **basal metabolic rate (BMR)**, **calories burned from general activity**, and **calories burned from specific exercises**, providing a more accurate and detailed overview of daily energy expenditure."
