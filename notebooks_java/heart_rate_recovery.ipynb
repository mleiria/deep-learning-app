    "This is a great example of a specific, focused data package. The JSON from `com.samsung.shealth.exercise.recovery_heart_rate` is designed to do one thing: track how your heart rate drops in the two minutes immediately after you finish an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the data and then create the corresponding POJO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of the JSON Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Package Purpose:** The package name itself tells the story. **Heart Rate Recovery (HRR)** is a key indicator of cardiovascular fitness. It measures how quickly your heart rate returns to a resting level after strenuous activity. A faster drop is a sign of a healthier heart. Samsung Health measures this in the 120 seconds (2 minutes) after you press \"Finish\" on a workout.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Top-Level Structure:** The JSON is a single object that contains a few key fields and a `chart_data` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Field-by-Field Breakdown:**\n",
    "    *   `\"is_valid\": true`: This boolean confirms that the recovery heart rate measurement was successful and the data is considered reliable. If the user moved too much or the watch had poor contact, this might be `false`.\n",
    "    *   `\"sampling_rate\": 1000`: This indicates a sampling rate of **1000 milliseconds**, meaning the app aims to log one heart rate reading **every second**.\n",
    "    *   `\"chart_data\"`: This is an array of objects, where each object is a heart rate measurement at a specific point during the recovery period.\n",
    "        *   `\"start_time\"`: The precise Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) of the heart rate reading. The first timestamp, `1758094441364`, corresponds to **Sunday, November 23, 2025, at 10:14:01.364 AM GMT**.\n",
    "        *   `\"elapsed_time\"`: The time in **milliseconds** that has passed *since the recovery period began*. This is the most useful field for plotting the recovery curve, as it starts near zero.\n",
    "        *   `\"heart_rate\"`: The user's heart rate in **beats per minute (bpm)** at that moment. In this data, the heart rate starts at 131 bpm and drops to 122 bpm over the course of about two minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Data Shows\n",
    "\n",
    "This data allows the Samsung Health app to calculate the drop in heart rate after one minute and two minutes. For example:\n",
    "*   **Heart Rate at start of recovery:** 131 bpm\n",
    "*   **Heart Rate after ~60 seconds:** 133 bpm (it briefly went up before coming down, which can happen)\n",
    "*   **Heart Rate after ~120 seconds:** 122 bpm\n",
    "\n",
    "The app would use these values to calculate the \"Recovery HR\" number you see on the workout summary screen (e.g., \"11 bpm recovery after 2 minutes\"). A larger drop is generally better.\n",
    "\n",
